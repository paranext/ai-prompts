## Feature Port: Creating Projects

**Classification:** Level A | **ParatextData Reuse:** 95% | **Effort:** Low to Medium

### Summary

Port the project creation functionality from PT9 to PT10, enabling users to create new translation projects, derived projects (back translations, daughter translations, Study Bibles), and consultant notes projects. This is a Level A feature where all core logic resides in ParatextData.dll and will be reused directly.

### Quick Links

- [Full Specification (README.md)](./README.md)
- [Behavior Catalog](./behavior-catalog.md) - 20 behaviors documented
- [Boundary Map](./boundary-map.md) - Architecture and data flow
- [API Contracts](./data-contracts.md) - TypeScript/C# type definitions
- [Test Specifications](./test-specifications/) - 85 specifications, 23 property tests

### Project Types Supported

- Standard translation
- Back translation (requires base project)
- Daughter translation (requires base project)
- Study Bible additions/publication (requires base project)
- Consultant notes (requires base project)
- Transliteration (manual/encoder)
- Auxiliary projects

### Key APIs (from ParatextData)

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `ScrText` | Project creation and configuration |
| `ScrTextCollection` | Registry and duplicate checking |
| `VersioningManager` | Mercurial init, GUID assignment |
| `TranslationInformation` | Project type handling |
| `ValidateShortName` | Name validation rules |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 20 PT9 behaviors preserved
- [ ] All 7 invariants enforced (unique names, GUIDs, derived project requirements, etc.)
- [ ] All 11 validation rules implemented (VAL-001 through VAL-011)
- [ ] Test specifications pass (85 specs)
- [ ] Property tests pass (23 tests)
- [ ] Human review approved

### Implementation Strategy

**Full TDD** - Level A feature with direct ParatextData reuse

#### Phase 3 Tasks

- [ ] C# IProjectCreationService wrapping ParatextData operations
- [ ] PAPI commands (createProject, validateProjectName, etc.)
- [ ] TypeScript types and validation utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end flow

#### Phase 4 Verification

- [ ] Equivalence verification against PT9 behavior
- [ ] Invariant verification (property tests)
- [ ] Final validation and human review

### Estimated Effort

| Area | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Backend integration | 1-2 days |
| UI development | 3-5 days |
| Testing | 2-3 days |

### Dependencies

**Requires:**
- User authentication (guest cannot create)
- Language management (BCP-47 validation)
- Versification system
- Mercurial VCS

**Enables:**
- Send/Receive
- Project Notes
- All project windows
- Import/Export

### Risk Areas

- **Medium**: Mercurial integration (process spawning)
- **Medium**: GUID calculation (timing-sensitive)
- **Low**: Cross-platform file system paths
